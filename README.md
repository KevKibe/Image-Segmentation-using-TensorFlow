# Image-Segmentation-using-TensorFlow
In this project we will use the TensorFlow machine learning framework to train and evaluate an image segmentation network using a medical imagery dataset.<br>

# Task
Perform semantic segmentation to classify each pixel in a cardiac MRI image whether the pixel is a part of the left ventricle (LV) or not.<br>

# Dataset
The data set is a series of cardiac images (specifically MRI short-axis (SAX) scans) that have been expertly labeled.<br>
For example; On the left are the MRI images and the right are the expertly-segmented regions (often called contours). The portions of the images that are part of the LV are denoted in white.
